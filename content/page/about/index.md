Welcome to anyone who come here for any reason. I'm pleased to introduce myself and the origin intention of building this website.

## About Me
I was born in 2002, and is an undergraduate at Tsinghua University the moment I type this line. I hold the belief that we were born to find the truth and stick to our faith. The subject I major in is CS, and I'm also interested in politics, economics, music, game and traveling.

## About this website
There are two main reasons for this website.

The first is to witness the process of my growing up. We all gonna die one day, this website is for leave a bit record of my thinking and my life.

The second is for communicating, we live in a time where the Internet is so convenient, but not so free to some aspects, but thanks to the skills I'm owning and the education I'm getting either passively or proactively, I am able to carve out a space on the Internet for free communication. This is important because we are all limited in our own lives, only communication remove the obstacles.

You can contact me by [nldxtd](mailto:nldxtd@gmail.com) :)  

## What I'm doing
- keeping thinking ü§î
- preparing for my further education üìñ
- improving my skills üòà
- in love ‚ù§Ô∏è
