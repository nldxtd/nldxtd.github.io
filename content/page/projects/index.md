## Summary
This Page is for displaying the projects I have been taking part in during my coding career, you can find the repos through my github account [nldxtd](https://github.com/nldxtd).

Those projects can be divided into two categories, one is course projects I 've been working on in THU classes, the other is personal projects made out of personal interests or outsourcing demands.

Apart from those projects, algorithm is also important through my study, which won't be displayed at this page.
